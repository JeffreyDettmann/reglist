  way_to_claim: If you see a tournament you would like to manage, click the 'claim' link and fill out the form explaining how we can verify that you should have permission to manage the tournament's information. For example, your email address may be  listed as a contact on the official rules.
  why_sign_up: Why should I create an account?
  why_we_should_accept_your_claim: Why we should accept your claim
  workflow_explanation: When you first create a tournament, it is in the "submitted" state. After you are happy with the information, you "accept" the tournament, which moves it into the "pending" state. You may then request that the administrators publish the tournament. At any stage, if you have questions or concerns, you can send a message to the administrators via the "Send a message!" form.
